# Mapping user flows to code.

This project is a POC for "Mapping user flows to code" concept.

The app has only one possible flow that cannot be executed on a concurrent way. There is only one flow execution happening at a time. The sequence of events is handled by an unique generator that
registers one time event listeners.


```
npm install
npm run build

```
